Some probiotic supplements even use a special enteric coating on the capsule that resists stomach acid letting the capsule pass into the small intestine where the coating dissolves in the more alkaline environment of the small intestine.

Here is a great big virtual hug and a reminder to be kind to yourself. You know what you need and you will get there in time. Be as kind to yourself as you are to others!\\n\\nWhat I have done since I had a baby is that I only buy sweets that I intend to eat within the next few (2-4 hours). If I want something later or the day after I cannot use the car (self imposed rule) but have to get the baby dressed appropriately and walk to the store to get it. Usually once I  make it to the store I have burnt some extra calories and I don\\'t feel like getting cookies or other sweet stuff. I usually end up with a piece of fruit (so I buy something and didn\\'t \"waste\" my time).
