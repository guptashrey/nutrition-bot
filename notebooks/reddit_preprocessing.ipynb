       "      <td>...where's the citation? You said there was a citation in the podcast. Well, I went to the approximate 25 minute mark, and here's what I heard:\\n\\n&gt;Fat is always being stored and burned at the same time, right?\\n\\n**No**. The term for burning fat is [lipolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipolysis), and as per wiki: \"lipolysis can only occur when insulin action falls to low levels, as occurs during fasting.\" Fat storage is called [lipogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogenesis); insulin likewise upregulates lipogenesis. Insulin's presence encourages lipogenesis; its absence allows lipolysis.\\n\\n&gt;It is the relative rates of each that are gonna determine the net that you deposit or lose.\\n\\nSure, kind of; but again, hormones bias the process in one direction, or the other, and not both, and yes, hormones do shut off either process from time to time. Why? Because doing so helps maintain homeostasis.\\n\\n&gt;So let's take two extreme diets: low carb high fat, and high carb low fat, right?\\n\\n...\\n\\n&gt;On a low carb diet, because you're eating a lot of fat, and your insulin's low, you will burn a lot of fat, but you are also storing a lot of fat.\\n\\n...okay, and?\\n\\n&gt;Because there have been studies to look at, okay, of the fat we store, how much comes from carbohydrate, and how much comes from fat? And they've done labeling studies where they can basically trace where these nutrients are going. Less than 2% of the fat stored in adiopse tissue originates as carbohydrate.\\n\\nFirst of all, that depends entirely on what percentage of your diet is carbs and what percent is fat. If you're eating a normal diet, then sure, that's been known for a while, the body burns its glucose first, and stores its fat, because that's easiest. But if you're eating enough to make you fat, then way more than 2% of the fat stored is gonna come from carbs. Why? Because your body stores its excess. That's how you get fat. You don't have to take my word for that, you can [ask Alice](https://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/does-carbohydrate-become-body-fat/):\\n\\n&gt;If you’re active and eating appropriately for your activity level, most of the carbs you consume are more or less burned immediately. \\[But\\] if you’re eating a lot more calories per day than you are burning, then yes, your liver will convert excess calories from carbohydrate into fats...\\n\\nAnd if you don't trust Columbia, it's just called [fatty acid synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_synthesis) and you do it with acetyl-CoA, the breakdown product of sugar.\\n\\nAlso: this isn't a citation. He just told a story about something he says he read.\\n\\n\\*Crucially, there is **zero**, and I mean **zero actual reference** to anything we can use to look at the same study he looked at, and see if there are any mistakes.\\n\\nThere is no citation, because we don't have any way to verify for ourselves the contents of the study, and he doesn't add a citation later, he just goes on to say:\\n\\n&gt;So if you're on a low carb high diet, you're burning a lot of fat, but you're also storing a lot of fat. If you're on a low fat high carb diet, you're not burning much fat, but you're also not storing much fat.\\n\\nThat's not how that works, but notice: **even if it it was** how it works, then the low carb high fat would **still be superior**. Why? Because if the body were really doing a bunch of excess metabolic activity by the stimulation of a low carb high fat diet, that would increase the resting metabolic rate, and burn more calories as a result. That's not how it actually works, but that's how it *would* work, if Dr. Norton were correct.\\n\\n&gt;So guess what actually ends up determining how much you gain or lose? Calories.\\n\\nI mean, sure, yeah, kind of. Calories are definitely important, and if you ignore the role that insulin plays in shutting off lipolysis, then Dr. Norton's views would be mechanistically correct. \\n\\nBut they're not, and I've shown why not, and [here](https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(21)00161-6/fulltext) are [three](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1840) more [examples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9762218/).\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet me just say too: I don't appreciate the tone very much of your snarky edit to the text of this post, about \"commenters who chose to ignore studies and rehash their false beliefs\". That doesn't seem in keeping with the rules about Reddiquette.</td>\n",

       "      <td>People who think that carbs are bad just don't understand the underlying principle of nutrient density.\\n\\nWhen we eat foods that don't give us enough nutrients to meet our bodies needs, our bodies will ramp up the hunger signals to tell us to keep eating until we get the nutrition we need. If we keep feeding it low nutrient density foods, then we will just continue to consume more and more calories without ever meeting our nutritional needs and never feel satiated. This principle applies to carbs, protein and fats. \\n\\nHigh carbohydrate foods tend to be less nutrient dense than foods higher in protein and fat. So a diet high in the wrong types of carbohydrates will almost always be nutrient deficient while providing a surplus of calories.</td>\n",

Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.\\n\\n**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  \\n\\n**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion.

Cool. Excess glucose will be then converted to glycogen and stored in your muscles or adipose and stored as fat\\n\\nIn a caloric surplus dietary fats will mostly be stored as adipose \\n\\n- - -\\n\\nSo… in a caloric surplus you get net gain of adipose fat from carbs or fats but generally mostly fats being stored but what if your diet was like 90% carbs well then assume calories are equal between the groups you get the **same amount** of fat stored as adipose but in this scenario it’s primarily from carbs because that’s where most of your calories are coming from.\\n\\nAnd the reverse would be true for dietary fats as well. (Meaning if your diet is mostly fats then your adipose and your energy will be primarily coming from fatty acids (ketone bodies) converted to ATP via lipolysis > Krebs\\n\\n\\nSo like all things it’s about balance.  \n",

Its is not surprising that iso-caloric diets result in approximately the same degree of weight loss.\\n\\nFor many people including me, LCHF \\[low carb high fat\\] (not keto) keeps one satiated at a much lower calorie level than HCLF \\[high carb low fat\\]. This helps with weight loss and maintenance.\\n\\nTo me the benefits of LCHF are: no food cravings, effortless weight maintenance, reduced insulin, reduced blood glucose and blood pressure, reduced risk of diabetes and other diseases.\\n\\nOf course, there is a lot of individual variations, some people do well on HCLF, others on LCHF and others in between.  \n",

Probably sugar spikes.  So sugar and cravings do make me fatter lol  \n",
       "8  ...where's the citation? You said there was a citation in the podcast. Well, I went to the approximate 25 minute mark, and here's what I heard:\\n\\n>Fat is always being stored and burned at the same time, right?\\n\\n**No**. The term for burning fat is [lipolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipolysis), and as per wiki: \"lipolysis can only occur when insulin action falls to low levels, as occurs during fasting.\" Fat storage is called [lipogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogenesis); insulin likewise upregulates lipogenesis. Insulin's presence encourages lipogenesis; its absence allows lipolysis.\\n\\n>It is the relative rates of each that are gonna determine the net that you deposit or lose.\\n\\nSure, kind of; but again, hormones bias the process in one direction, or the other, and not both, and yes, hormones do shut off either process from time to time. Why? Because doing so helps maintain homeostasis.\\n\\n>So let's take two extreme diets: low carb high fat, and high carb low fat, right?\\n\\n...\\n\\n>On a low carb diet, because you're eating a lot of fat, and your insulin's low, you will burn a lot of fat, but you are also storing a lot of fat.\\n\\n...okay, and?\\n\\n>Because there have been studies to look at, okay, of the fat we store, how much comes from carbohydrate, and how much comes from fat? And they've done labeling studies where they can basically trace where these nutrients are going. Less than 2% of the fat stored in adiopse tissue originates as carbohydrate.\\n\\nFirst of all, that depends entirely on what percentage of your diet is carbs and what percent is fat. If you're eating a normal diet, then sure, that's been known for a while, the body burns its glucose first, and stores its fat, because that's easiest. But if you're eating enough to make you fat, then way more than 2% of the fat stored is gonna come from carbs. Why? Because your body stores its excess. That's how you get fat. You don't have to take my word for that, you can [ask Alice](https://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/does-carbohydrate-become-body-fat/):\\n\\n>If you’re active and eating appropriately for your activity level, most of the carbs you consume are more or less burned immediately. \\[But\\] if you’re eating a lot more calories per day than you are burning, then yes, your liver will convert excess calories from carbohydrate into fats...\\n\\nAnd if you don't trust Columbia, it's just called [fatty acid synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_synthesis) and you do it with acetyl-CoA, the breakdown product of sugar.\\n\\nAlso: this isn't a citation. He just told a story about something he says he read.\\n\\n\\*Crucially, there is **zero**, and I mean **zero actual reference** to anything we can use to look at the same study he looked at, and see if there are any mistakes.\\n\\nThere is no citation, because we don't have any way to verify for ourselves the contents of the study, and he doesn't add a citation later, he just goes on to say:\\n\\n>So if you're on a low carb high diet, you're burning a lot of fat, but you're also storing a lot of fat. If you're on a low fat high carb diet, you're not burning much fat, but you're also not storing much fat.\\n\\nThat's not how that works, but notice: **even if it it was** how it works, then the low carb high fat would **still be superior**. Why? Because if the body were really doing a bunch of excess metabolic activity by the stimulation of a low carb high fat diet, that would increase the resting metabolic rate, and burn more calories as a result. That's not how it actually works, but that's how it *would* work, if Dr. Norton were correct.\\n\\n>So guess what actually ends up determining how much you gain or lose? Calories.\\n\\nI mean, sure, yeah, kind of. Calories are definitely important, and if you ignore the role that insulin plays in shutting off lipolysis, then Dr. Norton's views would be mechanistically correct. \\n\\nBut they're not, and I've shown why not, and [here](https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(21)00161-6/fulltext) are [three](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1840) more [examples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9762218/).\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet me just say too: I don't appreciate the tone very much of your snarky edit to the text of this post, about \"commenters who chose to ignore studies and rehash their false beliefs\". That doesn't seem in keeping with the rules about Reddiquette.  \n",

If we keep feeding it low nutrient density foods, then we will just continue to consume more and more calories without ever meeting our nutritional needs and never feel satiated. This principle applies to carbs, protein and fats. \\n\\nHigh carbohydrate foods tend to be less nutrient dense than foods higher in protein and fat. So a diet high in the wrong types of carbohydrates will almost always be nutrient deficient while providing a surplus of calories.  "

They didn't have the proper bowel flora to digest this new input and therefore some weird gases formed and thus farting. \\n\\nIf they stayed on this diet for 6 months or more their bowel flora would adjust and they would be just fine. It takes a while to build up the proper flora to digest different types of foods.   \n",

For almost a year straight, it was almost offensive, but the difference I felt was amazing, so I decided I'd live with the gas haha.. but it actually pretty much all went away. It was like a shock to the system or something, and I think it took a long time for my body to actually catch up, especially with the years of abuse. Totally worth it, in my opinion.   \n",
