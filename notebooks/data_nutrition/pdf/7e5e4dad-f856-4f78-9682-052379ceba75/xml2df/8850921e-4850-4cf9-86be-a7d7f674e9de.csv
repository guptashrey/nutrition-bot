The evolution of nutrition research.,91(4),257-67,"""The doctor of the future will no longer treat the human frame with drugs, but will rather cure and prevent disease with nutrition"". Thomas Edison's contemplation may come to fruition if the nutritional revolution continues in its current course. Two realizations have propelled the world into a new age of personalized nutrition: (i) food can provide benefits beyond its intrinsic nutrient content, and (ii) we are not all created equal in our ability to realize to these benefits. Nutrigenomics is concerned with delineating genomic propensities to respond to various nutritional stimuli and the resulting impact on individual health. This review will examine the current technologies utilized by nutrigeneticists, the available literature regarding nutrient-gene interactions, and the translation of this new awareness into public health.",Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,Isaak|Cara K|CK|;Siow|Yaw L|YL|,2013,23627837,D006801:Humans; D054647:Nutrigenomics; D052756:Nutritional Sciences; D009752:Nutritional Status; D011634:Public Health,"D016428:Journal Article; D013485:Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D016454:Review",,,10.1139/cjpp-2012-0367,,False,"Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Canadian Centre for Agri-Food Research in Health and Medicine, St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre, Winnipeg, MB R2H 2A6, Canada.",,,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,372712,0008-4212,Canada
