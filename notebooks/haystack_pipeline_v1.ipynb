Player vs Environment (PvE) combat was planned to be available at launch, although this was not a major priority.

After Djawadi had seen the preliminary animated title sequence the visual effect artists were still working on, he was inspired to write the piece. Djawadi said he intended to capture the overall impression of the series with the theme tune.  The title theme is unusually long for a television series at nearly two minutes long, and cello was chosen as the main instrument for the music as he thought it has a \"darker sound\" that suited the series.  The main title theme may also be incorporated into other music segments within the show, particularly at climactic moments.\\n\\n===Houses and characters===\\nDjawadi composed an individual leitmotif or theme for each of the major houses, as well as for some locations and some characters.

These themes are often played in scenes involving them and they can be used to tell a story.  Not all characters would have their own themes due to the large number of characters in the series. The theme for House Stark is the first theme to be composed and is played on a cello. Most of the Stark characters only have variations on the same theme on cello. Arya Stark is the first of the house to have her own theme, first heard when she started her lesson on swordplay in episode three of season one, with the music featuring a hammered dulcimer. A new theme for Jon Snow, previously using only the House Stark theme, was created in the sixth season and prominently featured in the episode \"Battle of the Bastards\".  It was first heard at the end of episode three when he said \"My watch is ended\", signifying a shift in the character after he had been resurrected.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 5}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '1d1180e6f4ad31f6ac846d2a1f8a7cbc'}>,\n",

House Lannister has an associated song, \"The Rains of Castamere\", which became their theme.  The song was played at the Red Wedding, but first heard when Tyrion Lannister whistled a small part in the first episode of the second season.  When a theme has become established, different versions that are darker or lighter are then introduced, and concepts such as honor and conspiracy are also represented in themes.\\n\\nDjawadi chose distinctive sounds and instruments for different leitmotifs and themes, for example, didgeridoos are used for the wildlings, while the Armenian duduk flute is used for the Dothrakis.

The themes for the White Walkers and the Night King are more of sound designs rather than regular themes; the White Walker theme initially employed a glass harmonica for a \"really high, eerie, icy sound\", but became fully orchestral when the army of the dead was revealed in the season two finale.  The theme music for the White Walker extended over time into the music of the Army of the Dead, representing the gathering strength of Army of the Dead, which was only introduced in full in the finale of the seventh season when the Wall fell.\\n\\nThe themes may evolve over time in the series.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has stated that \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.\"A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story.

After his betrothed Lyanna Stark was kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen, Robert, along with the aid of her brother and his close friend, Eddard Stark, and their foster guardian Jon Arryn, initiated a bloody rebellion against the \"Mad King\" Aerys II Targaryen.  After crushing the Targaryen dynasty and winning the war, Robert took the Iron Throne and established the Baratheon dynasty as its first king.  However, due to Lyanna\\'s untimely death during the war, Robert instead married Tywin Lannister\\'s daughter Cersei to ensure political stability.

Originally hailing from a minor family with little wealth or influence, Baelish used manipulation, bribery, and the connections he secured at Riverrun to gain power and prestige in King's Landing. Since then, his various intrigues have directly caused several major events that have impacted Westeros, including the framing of Tyrion Lannister for the attempt on Bran Stark's life, the downfall of Lord Eddard Stark, the deaths of Lord Jon Arryn and King Joffrey Baratheon, and the War of the Five Kings.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '186f29e83a7d51855aa4cfded4f33355'}>,\n",

Martin reflects: \"I think the battle between good and evil is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions that we make.

This viewpoint characterizes the book and is evident in the actions of several different families which frequently have conflicts with each other.

Rather than divide the text in half chronologically, Martin opted to instead split the material by character and location, resulting in \"two novels taking place simultaneously\" with different casts of characters. \\'\\'A Feast for  Crows\\'\\' was published months later, and the concurrent novel \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' was released on July 12, 2011.

In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of \"fire\". This light has a continuous spectrum. Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame.

Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of \"Green Dragon\".\\n\\nThe glow of a flame is complex. Black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands.

Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.\\n\\nThe common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame).

There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.\\n\\nIn combustion engines, various steps are taken to eliminate a flame.

A jacquard loom is one in which a series of punched cards each corresponds to a row of the design to be woven, allowing for a greater definition of motifs. The punched cards operate a mechanism attached to the loom, controlling the pick-up of weft threads as the design evolves. In the case of the ''Game of Thrones Tapestry'', it has allowed the weavers to introduce a rich palette of colours and considerable level of detail throughout the work.\\n\\nJacquard looms have often been credited with inspiring the development of the very first computers.

Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the anticipation from there, without tipping in either direction.\"Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, \"The Rains of Castamere\", in order to create more of a mystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, and Djawadi instructed the boys to sing in such a way that although it is \"not out of tune, but you get that feeling of Something’s wrong.\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '977c3b65c1be94ddf8fa65b0bce87690'}>,\n",
