This has been suggested as a mechanism explaining\\na lower insulin response to unfermented compared with yeast-\\nfermented rye crispbread(16), because the high molecular\\nweight of soluble fibre contributes to increased digesta\\nviscosity, which might reduce gastric emptying rate and the\\ndigestion and absorption rate of nutrients(32). Despite demon-\\nstrated effects caused by sourdough fermentation and a\\nconsumer perception that sourdough bread is healthy(33),\\nstudies evaluating the role of sourdough for appetite and\\nmetabolic responses remain scarce.\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6792174832472085, 'meta': {'_split_id': 13, 'year': 1999}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '647c6f56157c5c829d2dead43aae7b4e'}>,\n",
